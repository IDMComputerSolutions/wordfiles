# UltraEdit/UEStudio wordfiles

The official repo for UE/UES wordfiles, as seen on [ultraedit.com](http://www.ultraedit.com/downloads/extras/wordfiles.html).

### Adding a wordfile
Users who are less comfortable with git and/or GitHub are still welcome to submit new wordfiles to support@ultraedit.com. But we encourage
more advanced users to submit any proposed changes or new syntax files directly 0through our GitHub page. Submit a pull request, and once we've 
verified your work, we'll merge, deploy and publish for the rest of the UE community. We thank you in advance for your awesome contributions!

As a general guideline - we'd like to keep this repo as clean as possible for programmatic access via the GitHub API.
